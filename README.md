## YOU MAY NOT USE ANYTHING WITHIN THIS REPOSITORY FOR SCHOOL PROJECTS/LABS/ASSIGNMENTS
An ATM machine (with GUI) created for a class project. The goal was to have a fully functionable ATM machine with GUI.


The ATM machine consists of the following functionality:
* Login
  * User would need to input card # and PIN #.
  * PIN # gets displayed as bullet points to prevent anyone from seeing your PIN # (NOTE: IT IS NOT ENCRYPTED).
  * PIN # gets inputed via the numpad.
  * Create new account feature was added after the project was over and graded. It was a side feature that was planned to be implemented after class but never had time to do.
  * LOGIN BUTTON & OK are linked together. Both those buttons would login the user (if card# existed and PIN was correct)
